She has more than 25 years of experience in the food and business industries in Colombia and the United States. While living in Cartagena, she owned a restaurant and catering business for 20 years. Isela Beltran is a political asylee in the United States. She fled Cartagena in 2015 due to the persecution by the government for her activism defending the Black and Afro-descendant communities of Colombia. Too Sabrozo Delicatessen was born searching for new opportunities, a business that fulfills her dream and passion for cuisine. Isela ensures that each dish contains a big portion of love, authenticity, and above all, that SABROZO flavor transports you to your home and extraordinary places. She sells at local farmers' markets, is a supplier to local specialty grocers, offers deliveries, and caters for events. Too Sabrozo Deli offers arepas, sandwiches, juices, tamales, and more for carnivores and vegetarians alike. Isela first found the IRC through the Torture Survivors program and resettlement services. In February 2019, once Isela was settled, she saw a need for Columbian food in San Diego and was ready to start her business. She was connected to the IRC SBDC and was a great fit as the advisors are multilingual and aware of refugees' unique obstacles. With the work of her business advisor, Isela accessed a $15,000 loan to build a food truck. Soon after, the COVID pandemic reduced her sales, and she needed help to finish all the necessary steps to complete her food truck and expand sales. Determined, Isela reconnected with the IRC through the Community Navigator Pilot Program in 2021. She received specialized business counseling from two regional Community Navigators at the IRC San Diego office and ACCESS, Inc. Through the collaboration, Isela accessed a Kiva loan totaling $6,500 in November to reach her goal. She was able to finish her food truck and bring it up to current health code requirements. To obtain a Kiva loan, Isela crowdfunded a portion of the loan amount herself.  Now, the business is investing in a food trailer and working towards the long-term goal of becoming a restaurant and eventually having its brand become a Colombian food chain.",image:"https://i.ibb.co/hKswVwB/SD-Photo.png"},{id:1,title:"Access to Capital",description:"Issac 'Ike' Rayford worked for Groundswell, LLC, a business that specialized in video and audio production, video and audio system design, and sales and installation. He started in 2015 on the business's video and audio production side. Shortly after starting, the company was split and sold to two employees. Ike continued to work for the employee that purchased the design, sales, and installation part of the business. Though, the new owner did not enjoy business management, sales, or customer service aspects of the company; however, he had excellent technical skills. The former owner remained active in the business and was able to assist in the areas where the new owner lacked skill and ability. Early in the pandemic, Ike, like most of the other staff, lost his job after live events came to a grinding halt. The former owner also stopped actively managing the business. Ike used the time to launch and offer professional development training to local companies and organizations. Initially, the training programs were primarily on diversity and inclusion. Ike had been an active member of the local NAACP chapter for many years and worked tirelessly with the City of Sioux City to develop an Inclusion Liaison position. Consequently, Ike was uniquely qualified to provide training on diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Later he added other course offerings that included coaching, leadership, stress management, time management, and positive communication. 2021 was the year Ike returned to his production job part-time, though he continued to operate his training and professional development business. Ike noticed that the company he had returned to was not the same and needed new leadership to reinvigorate the operation. The owner wanted to sell, and Ike expressed interest in purchasing the production business. Ike sought the services of the local SBDC to develop a business plan and financial projection. The SBDC referred Ike to the IRC's Community Navigator Pilot Program at Siouxland Economic Development Corporation/Iowa West Coast Initiative (SEDC/IWCI) for financing to acquire the business. The Community Navigator provided Ike with counseling services to complete his financial projection, develop a good business plan, and prepare a loan application. Ike had in-depth knowledge of what the business needed to succeed and how well those needs aligned with his skill set. However, he had little business or personal financial literacy. Ike worked with his Community Navigators to improve these aspects of his financing application and personal financial situation. He successfully started and scaled his training and professional development business and proved his management, sales, and customer service ability. Additionally, Groundswell, LLC, was the only service provider to commercial customers in the greater Siouxland area; though the company's financial condition continued deteriorating, which complicated his loan approval. Community Navigators worked with Ike to negotiate with the seller and provide a portion of the equity injection. Ike then used personal funds as working capital to support operations and improve the business's financial condition. The business community wanted these services provided by a local business, not competitors 90-120 miles away. SEDC's Executive Committee agreed there was a great need to retain this important business in the local area and took note of Ike's technical and business management skills. SEDC approved Ike's financing application for $70,000 based on these factors. Ike was the driving force in making this possible and indicated he would not have been able to navigate the process without the assistance of the CNPP program.",image:"https://i.ibb.co/c23J19d/Iowa-1.jpg"}];var c=function(){var e=(0,s.useState)(!1),t=e[0],a=e[1],c=(0,s.useState)(),h=c[0],u=c[1];return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"px-10 max-w-7xl mx-auto",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative mx-auto mt-8 max-w-7xl border-b-8 border-sbaBlue pb-8 md:mt-12",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-4xl font-extrabold text-sbaBlue sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl",children:"CNPP NEWS"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"py-5 font-bold md:w-7/12 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl",children:"Get the latest news, updates and hear how a Community Navigator can help small businesses."}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{children:(0,n.jsx)(i.default,{href:"/contact",children:(0,n.jsx)("button",{className:"flex items-center justify-center rounded-md border border-transparent bg-sbaYellow px-8 py-2 text-base font-medium text-sbaBlue hover:bg-sbaGray md:text-lg",children:"Subscribe"})})})]}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-screen-lg py-16 lg:py-24",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"text-2xl font-extrabold uppercase tracking-wide text-sbaBlue md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl",children:"Small Business Owner Spotlight"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"mt-8 font-bold md:mb-10 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl",children:"Learn about other Small Business Owners and their experiences with CNPP."}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:" flex min-h-fit max-w-screen-lg flex-col flex-wrap content-center md:mt-0 md:flex-row md:flex-wrap md:justify-between",children:[d.map((function(e,t){return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"relative mt-10 h-[300px] w-11/12 md:w-1/2 self-auto md:h-[400px] lg:h-[700px]",children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative h-[300px] w-11/12 md:h-[400px] lg:h-[700px]",children:[(0,n.jsx)("img",{src:e.image,alt:"",className:"h-full w-full object-cover"}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"absolute top-0 left-0 h-full w-full bg-black opacity-40"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"absolute left-2 bottom-10 py-8 text-lg font-bold text-white sm:text-2xl",children:e.title}),(0,n.jsx)("button",{id:"0",onClick:function(t){t.preventDefault(),a(!0),u(e.id)},className:"absolute right-0 bottom-0 bg-sbaYellow py-2 px-8 font-bold text-sbaBlue hover:bg-sbaGray md:py-3 md:px-10",children:"Read more"})]})})})),t&&(0,n.jsx)(r.default,{setShowModal:a,content:d,activeIdx:h})]})]}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-screen-xl border-t-8 border-sbaBlue py-3",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"pt-10 text-2xl font-extrabold uppercase tracking-wide text-sbaBlue md:text-4xl",children:"Latest Updates"}),(0,n.jsx)(o.default,{})]}),(0,n.jsx)(l.default,{})]})}},3488:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,{default:function(){return r}});var n=a(5893),s=a(7294),i=a(8949),o=[{index:0,content:"Check back soon for updates and get connected to a CNPP counselor.",link:""}],r=function(){var e=(0,s.useState)([]),t=e[0],a=e[1];return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"accordion mt-4 mb-6",children:o.map((function(e){return(0,n.jsxs)(i.default,{date:e.date,activeIdx:t,setActiveIdx:a,index:e.index,children:[(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"mb-4",children:e.content}),(0,n.jsx)("a",{href:e.link,target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer noopener",children:e.link})]})}))})}}}]);
