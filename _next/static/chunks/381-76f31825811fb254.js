After settling in the United States, Shirley knew she wanted to make more for herself and sought out the Latin American Association (LAA) to receive support with starting a business. From the start, she has been passionate about sharing her love of baked goods and pastries with her new community. Since September 2020, Shirley has worked with the Latin American Association, one of the spokes in Atlanta\u2019s Community Navigator Pilot Project. However, after registering her business and finalizing her business plan, Shirley\u2019s hopes to start Sweet Toppings ATL came to a stop when COVID-19 hit. The impacts were so detrimental that Shirley returned to Ecuador to live with her family and had to cease her business.  In January, after returning to the United States and working as an assistant manager at IHOP for a year, Shirley connected again with the LAA. She decided to leave IHOP to pursue her business full-time. Despite the risk Shirley knew she was taking, she reminded LAA staff that Sweet Toppings ATL was her dream, and that she \u201chopes to see her business grow and eventually franchise like IHOP.\u201d After refining her business plan and taking on her first clients, Shirley enrolled in the Community Navigator Pilot Project this quarter. Her navigator provided Shirley with 39 hours of counseling and training on digital marketing, social media for business owners, Google platforms, Serv Safe, and more. In collaboration with the navigators at the IRC in Atlanta, Shirley attended a grant clinic and applied to local and national grant opportunities, totaling $70,000. In just a few months of restarting her business, and with support from her navigator and other resource partners, Shirley is a successful business owner living her dream. She now works full-time from home and can care for her son. She generates $5,000 per month in profit and saw a 36 percent salary increase. In the future, Shirley plans to work with her navigator and open a coffee shop in a nearby neighborhood.",image:"https://i.ibb.co/0hX164d/atl-1.jpg"},{id:1,title:"Business Counseling & Market Access",description:"Ernest Nteza, a migrant from Uganda, arrived in the U.S. more than five years ago. Inspired by his grandmother, Ernest founded a coffee company in 2018. The company is centered around the values his grandmother upheld, such as appreciating the differences in people, community, and taking care of others.\u202fEarnest and Humble, an East African coffee company, strives to cultivate and process its coffee using sustainable practices concerning the environmental impact and people connected to the industry. Ernest joined the IRC's Community Navigator Pilot Program after the Lagos PHX navigator connected with him, and he is so glad that he did.\u202f'The advice and insights I get on how to approach things in my business are incredible. You can doubt yourself and go through highs and lows, so it's always good to have someone to talk to', Nteza said. He is thankful for the CNPP program because it is difficult to find someone that can relate to his business struggles and needs. Since working with his navigator at Lagos PHX, a regional spoke, he has someone to glean advice and counsel. The navigator assisted Ernest to investigate market opportunities and provided counseling on how to pitch his product to retail stores. Because of this, exciting things have happened for the company, and he secured retail locations.\u202fEarnest and Humble\u202frecently launched at the Phoenix Public Market this quarter at Sky Harbor Airport and will be launching at AJ's Fine Foods on Central and Camelback in Phoenix later this year. He operates\u202fEarnest and Humble\u202fwith the strong belief that all humans are connected, and coffee is the key to forging and strengthening the relationship between people, cultures, and communities. A faith-based business, Ernest wants to speak joy and peace to people experiencing trials and provide comfort.\u202f'We're seeing the humans behind this beverage. It creates opportunities for us to know them, to care about the environment, their livelihood, and what goes into their cup.' Nteza stated.\u202fIts mission is to create specialty coffee that tells a story of its origins and the people who worked to provide the product to the consumer. Coffee has its characteristics, notes, and flavors, and he wants people to be able to appreciate that and educate on specialty coffee. Moreover, he wants to put the spotlight on coffee origins coming from Africa and its regions. As part of his business model, Ernest seeks to help coffee farmers achieve a livable wage and strives to build relationships to further the growth of Africa\u2019s coffee production.\u202f Follow Earnest and Humble on Instagram,\u202f@earnestandhumbleco.",image:"https://i.ibb.co/71kgL7p/phoenix-1.jpg"}];var d=function(){var e=(0,s.useState)(!1),t=e[0],a=e[1],d=(0,s.useState)(),h=d[0],u=d[1];return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"px-10 max-w-7xl mx-auto",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative mx-auto mt-8 max-w-7xl border-b-8 border-sbaBlue pb-8 md:mt-12",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-4xl font-extrabold text-sbaBlue sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl",children:"CNPP NEWS"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"py-5 font-bold md:w-7/12 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl",children:"Get the latest news, updates and hear how a Community Navigator can help small businesses."}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{children:(0,n.jsx)(i.default,{href:"/contact",children:(0,n.jsx)("button",{className:"flex items-center justify-center rounded-md border border-transparent bg-sbaYellow px-8 py-2 text-base font-medium text-sbaBlue hover:bg-sbaGray md:text-lg",children:"Subscribe"})})})]}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-screen-lg py-16 lg:py-24",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"text-2xl font-extrabold uppercase tracking-wide text-sbaBlue md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl",children:"Small Business Owner Spotlight"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"mt-8 font-bold md:mb-10 md:text-xl lg:text-2xl",children:"Learn about other Small Business Owners and their experiences with CNPP."}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:" flex min-h-fit max-w-screen-lg flex-col flex-wrap content-center md:mt-0 md:flex-row md:flex-wrap md:justify-between",children:[c.map((function(e,t){return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"relative mt-10 h-[300px] w-11/12 md:w-1/2 self-auto md:h-[400px] lg:h-[700px]",children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative h-[300px] w-11/12 md:h-[400px] lg:h-[700px]",children:[(0,n.jsx)("img",{src:e.image,alt:"",className:"h-full w-full object-cover"}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"absolute top-0 left-0 h-full w-full bg-black opacity-40"}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"absolute left-2 bottom-10 py-8 text-lg font-bold text-white sm:text-2xl",children:e.title}),(0,n.jsx)("button",{id:"0",onClick:function(t){t.preventDefault(),a(!0),u(e.id)},className:"absolute right-0 bottom-0 bg-sbaYellow py-2 px-8 font-bold text-sbaBlue hover:bg-sbaGray md:py-3 md:px-10",children:"Read more"})]})})})),t&&(0,n.jsx)(o.default,{setShowModal:a,content:c,activeIdx:h})]})]}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-screen-xl border-t-8 border-sbaBlue py-3",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"pt-10 text-2xl font-extrabold uppercase tracking-wide text-sbaBlue md:text-4xl",children:"Latest Updates"}),(0,n.jsx)(r.default,{})]}),(0,n.jsx)(l.default,{})]})}},3488:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,{default:function(){return o}});var n=a(5893),s=a(7294),i=a(8949),r=[{index:0,date:"March 31, 2022",content:"The IRC\u2019s CNPP website is live!
