<p><b>Queer to Stay: An LGBTQ+ Business Preservation Initiative</b>: Over the past three years, the “Queer to Stay” initiative has awarded funds to fifty LGBTQ+ businesses nationwide. This year, the Human Rights Campaign and SHOWTIME® have increased their commitment to 75. While the COVID-19 National Emergency has ended, LGBTQ+-serving businesses still face financial challenges and are at risk of closure. LGBTQ+ bars, centers, and businesses often serve as safe and affirming places for many of the community, especially young queer and trans people and communities of color. The Queer to Stay initiative is specifically focused on supporting US-based, for-profit businesses, and eligibility includes: business should primarily serve the LGBTQ community, including LGBTQ Communities of Color, the LGBTQ Womens Community, and or the Transgender and Non-Binary Community; the business must explain how they have been negatively impacted financially due to COVID-19; Special consideration will be given to businesses that are owned by members of the communities we are trying to serve through this initiative -- queer people of color, queer women and transgender and non-binary individuals. We will also prioritize funding for businesses that did not receive a donation from the Queer to Stay initiative previously. HRC and SHOWTIME have created a video highlighting former QUEER TO STAY recipients to help encourage LGBTQ+ businesses to apply.
