        description: "Wichai is the proud owner of a local Salt Lake City restaurant, Laan Na Thai,  which opened in 2016. Like many business owners, COVID-19 impacted their operations through a reduction of dine-in customers and loss of sales. Fortunately, he was one of the business owners who were able to apply for and receive the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan. However, when the loan forgiveness application came out, Wichai found the application process difficult and confusing as a limited English speaker to navigate. The IRC CNPP small business team, with the help of an interpreter, assisted him to collect all the necessary documents and apply for forgiveness support to Wichai in the entire process. Wichai was approved, and because of the assistance he received through CNPP, the business was able to receive $33,644 in PPP loan forgiveness. Now, the family can focus on business operations and recovery without further liability.",

        description: "Barwin is the owner and chef of Aleppo Kitchen in Atlanta, Georgia. Originally from Syria, she is a wife, mother of five, and former high school history teacher, passionate about bringing traditional Syrian food to her new community. Launched in 2018, Barwin worked with the IRC to get her business license, ServSafe certification,and develop her social media and website pages. Before COVID-19, Barwin enjoyed catering events and parties. However, when the pandemic hit Georgia, she pivoted her business to operate mainly through farmers’ market stalls around Atlanta. In December, Barwin needed new equipment to expand her business and provide new products to customers, like falafel. She worked with a CNPP business advisor to prepare her loan application and receive a $10,000 loan with no interest or fees through the IRC’s Center of Economic Opportunity. With this loan, Barwin purchased much-needed equipment for her kitchen to meet customer demands and increase business revenue.",
