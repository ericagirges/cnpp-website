      ' The International Rescue Committee (IRC) helps people affected by humanitarian crises—including the climate crisis—to survive, recover and rebuild their lives. Founded at the call of Albert Einstein in 1933, the IRC is now at work in over 40 crisis-affected countries as well as communities throughout Europe and the Americas. We deliver a lasting impact by providing health care, helping children learn, and empowering individuals and communities to become self-reliant, always seeking to address the inequalities facing women and girls.',

    Part of a $100 million federal American Rescue Plan Act
    initiative to support small business economic recovery, the
    Community Navigator Pilot Program will help small business
    owners build back resilient, thriving companies. The program
    utilizes a “hub and spoke” model from public health care
    federal programming, leveraging partnerships with trusted
    community-based organizations to help small businesses
    navigate government resources and critical resources. In the
    two-year Community Navigator Pilot Program initiative, the IRC
    will work with over 21 community-based partners across
    Arizona, California, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, and Utah to
    support up to 3,000 diverse small business owners. With a
    specific focus on refugee and immigrant business owners, the
    IRC will help these businesses recover from the impacts of
    COVID by providing counseling, technical assistance, and
    support accessing up to $30 million in small business relief.
